Heart Disease Prediction
======
This report will discuss Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as it’s a silent killer as well as being one of the top causes of death globally. My aim is to see if high blood pressure is the top leading cause of heart disease and to predict to a reasonable accuracy the death event for a patient with high blood pressure. This assumes that high blood pressure is the leading cause, however if it is not the leading cause based on the data then I will use what is the best variable/symptom that gives the best results. I plan to use model fitting for multiple models and compare the results to determine the best fitting model for this data. After analyzing the data my hypothesis that high blood pressure was the leading cause of Cardiovascular diseases was incorrect and instead the Ejection Fraction feature had the most influence in deaths caused by CVDs.'

GPU Forecast and Analysis
======
This project will discuss the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) performance over time as well as predict what the performance of GPUs in the year 2030. For the past 10 years the growth of computer games has resulted in competitive development of Graphics Cards. I want to see if the competitive nature of the graphics card market pushes past Moors law or if Moors law is a limiting factor in the development of new Graphics Cards. To predict the performance of graphics cards in 2030 I will need to use regression models to get a good estimate. In order to focus on performance of GPUs I will need to specifically focus o 3 parameters. Core speed [MHz], Memory Bandwidth [GB/sec] and Memory size [MB or GB].

Australia Weather Prediction
======
In this project I try to answer the question that whether or not it will rain the next day in Australia. This project implements Logistic Regression and Scikit-Learn libraries. To answer this question, I built a classifier to predict whether or not it will rain the next day in Australia. I trained a binary classification model using logistic regression. I used a dataset that contains 10 years of daily weather observations from 2008-2017 from the Australian weather stations. Although the dataset is very complete there is some cleaning steps that need to be done prior to training the dataset and fitting it to our binary classification model. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle and the description for the dataset suggested to remove RISK_MM variable that may skew results so that was addressed in the cleaning steps. My target variable is RainTomorrow that gives a binary output of Yes or NO, this allows us to run our model over our entire dataset and get a good accuracy. I used feature scaling to normalize the range of independent variables and features of our train and test sets, this will follow with our model training of our training set to be fed into the Logistic Regression classifier. Once the train and test set were created, we could use sklearn for our Logistic Regression and fit it into a binary classification model. This Model gave us an accuracy score of 85%. Overall this is a good enough accuracy to use in the real world and to adopt for weather stations and may even be improved on in the future with more data.

Airline safety vs DrivingUS
======
In recent weeks there has been some questions about the safeties of air travel compared to driving. With recent incidents like the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine on Thursday, following the disappearance of its Flight 370 in March, is the second mysterious incident involving the airline this year. The incidents don’t appear to be related, but that isn’t preventing people from insisting that they’ll never fly Malaysia Airlines again. Some of them will follow through — academic studies have found that high-profile crashes can shift passenger demand away from the airlines involved in the disasters.

Credit Card Fraud
======
For this mid term I used a credit card dataset that contains fraudulent and unfraudulent data. This assignment asked me to clean and structure this dataset

Web Scrape and Analysis
======
For my this project I scrapped a webpage that had data from a 10K race that took place in Hillsboro, OR on June 2017
