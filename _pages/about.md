Heart Disease Prediction
======
This report will discuss Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as itâ€™s a silent killer as well as being one of the top causes of death globally. My aim is to see if high blood pressure is the top leading cause of heart disease and to predict to a reasonable accuracy the death event for a patient with high blood pressure. This assumes that high blood pressure is the leading cause, however if it is not the leading cause based on the data then I will use what is the best variable/symptom that gives the best results. I plan to use model fitting for multiple models and compare the results to determine the best fitting model for this data. After analyzing the data my hypothesis that high blood pressure was the leading cause of Cardiovascular diseases was incorrect and instead the Ejection Fraction feature had the most influence in deaths caused by CVDs.'

GPU Forecast and Analysis
======
This project will discuss the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) performance over time as well as predict what the performance of GPUs in the year 2030. For the past 10 years the growth of computer games has resulted in competitive development of Graphics Cards. I want to see if the competitive nature of the graphics card market pushes past Moors law or if Moors law is a limiting factor in the development of new Graphics Cards. To predict the performance of graphics cards in 2030 I will need to use regression models to get a good estimate. In order to focus on performance of GPUs I will need to specifically focus o 3 parameters. Core speed [MHz], Memory Bandwidth [GB/sec] and Memory size [MB or GB].
