A bit about myself
======

Hello, my name is Tyler Anderson I work as an application engineer working with salesforce at a global payments company. I used to be a middle school science teacher before I moved to a new career and was fascinated with the data used in teaching. I am from Omaha Nebraska and been playing tennis for over 10 years. The data in classrooms was not the only interest that got me into technology, I was interested in building computers from a young age and from that interest sprouted my learning in data and data science.
